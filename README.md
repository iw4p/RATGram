# RATGram
RATGram is a RAT which is written in python language and collaboration with Telegram Bot API.

## How does it work exactly?
Via Telegram Bot you can access to the target remotely.
Instead of running python bot file on server, You just need to run the bot on target system, It's going to run on the background and run automatically even system restart.

# To-Do

- [ ] Run script on background 
- [ ] Run again automatically after restarting system

- [ ] Get user data (IP, Location, ...) 
- [ ] Able to run cmds like `ls`, `cd` and ... on the bot
- [ ] Able to download files from target system
- [ ] Able to upload files on target system
